* DONE Lecture 01: Course Overview + The Shell

Let's assume that =foo= is a file that only root can modify.

#+begin_src shell
  echo 500 > foo
#+end_src

The command above won't work when run as a regular user.

#+begin_src shell
  sudo echo 500 > foo
#+end_src

This one won't work either. =sudo= is being used for =echo= only.
Redirection =>= just takes the output and tries to write it to the =foo= file as a regular user.

To solve this one could login as root and run the command again.

It can be done without switching to the root's shell though.

#+begin_src shell
  echo 500 | sudo tee foo
#+end_src

=tee= copies standard input to standard output and making a copy in zero or more files.

=xdg-open= opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application.
